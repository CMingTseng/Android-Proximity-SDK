# Estimote Proximity SDK for Android 

Estimote Proximity SDK aims to provide a simple way for apps to react to physical context by reading signals from Estimote Beacons.

Why should you use it?

1. Reliability. It's built upon Estimote Monitoring, Estimote's algorithm for reliable enter/exit reporting.
2. No need to operate on abstract identifiers, or Proximity UUID, Major, Minor triplets. Estimote Proximity SDK lets you define zones by setting predicates for human-readable JSONs.
3. You can define multiple zones for a single beacon, i.e. at different ranges.
4. Cloud-backed grouping. When you change your mind and want to replace one beacon with another, all you need to do is reassign JSON attachments in Estimote Cloud. You don't even need to connect to the beacon!

## Requirements

- One or more [Estimote Proximity or Location Beacon](https://estimote.com/products/) with the `Estimote Location` packet advertising enabled. 
- An Android device with Bluetooth Low Energy support. We suggest using Android Lollipop or newer. 

## Installation

Add this line to your `build.gradle` file:
```Gradle
compile 'com.estimote:proximity-sdk:0.1.0-alpha.4'
```
Note: this is a pre-release version of Estimote Proximity SDK for Android.

## Attachment-based identification

Details of each of your Estimote devices are available in Estimote Cloud. Each device has a unique identifier, but remembering it and using it for every one of your devices can be challenging. This is why Estimote Proximity SDK uses attachment-based identification.

Each device has an associated JSON. When the SDK detects a change in the proximity to a device, it checks the device's attachment JSON to see which of the registered rules should be applied.

During the pre-release stage of Estimote Proximity SDK, attachment JSONs are encoded in tags. The convention for a tag-encoded attachment is

```
{
    "attachment" : {
        // Attachment JSON goes here.
        // You can put here any JSON you wish to use in your apps.
    }
}
```

## 0. Setting up attachments in Cloud 
1. Go to https://cloud.estimote.com/#/
2. Click on the beacon you want to configure
3. Click the Edit settings button
4. Click the Tags field
5. Click the Create New Tag button
6. Paste in the JSON with attachment that's going to represent your beacon
7. Click Save changes
Tags are Cloud-only settings â€” no additional connecting to the beacons with the Estimote app is required.

## 1. Build proximity observer
The `ProximityObserver` is the main object for performing proximity observations. Build it using `ProximityObserverFactory` - and don't forget to put in your Estimote Cloud credentials!

```Kotlin
// Kotlin
val cloudCredentials = EstimoteCloudCredentials(YOUR_APP_ID_HERE , YOUR_APP_TOKEN_HERE)
val proximityObserver = ProximityObserverFactory().create(applicationContext, cloudCredentials)
```

```Java
// Java
EstimoteCloudCredentials cloudCredentials = new EstimoteCloudCredentials(YOUR_APP_ID_HERE, YOUR_APP_TOKEN_HERE);
ProximityObserver proximityObserver = new ProximityObserverFactory().create(getApplicationContext(), cloudCredentials);
```

## 2. Define proximity rules
Now for the fun part - create your own proximity rules using `proximityObserver.ruleBuilder()`

```Kotlin
// Kotlin
val venueZone = proximityObserver.zoneBuilder()
                .forAttachmentKeyAndValue("venue", "office")
                .inFarRange()
                .withOnEnterAction{/* do something here */}
                .withOnExitAction{/* do something here */}
                .withOnChangeAction{/* do something here */}
                .create()
```

```Java
// Java
ProximityRule rule1 = 
    proximityObserver.zoneBuilder()
        .forAttachmentKeyAndValue("venue", "office")
        .inFarRange()
        .withOnEnterAction(new Function1<ProximityAttachment, Unit>() {
          @Override public Unit invoke(ProximityAttachment proximityAttachment) {
            /* Do something here */
            return null;
          }
        })
        .withOnExitAction(new Function0<Unit>() {
          @Override public Unit invoke() {
             /* Do something here */
             return null;
          }
        })
        .withOnChangeAction(new Function1<List<? extends ProximityAttachment>, Unit>() {
          @Override
          public Unit invoke(List<? extends ProximityAttachment> proximityAttachments) {
            /* Do something here */
            return null;
          }
        })
        .create();
```
- **forAttachmentKey** - the key you want to trigger actions for. 
- **forAttachmentKeyAndValue** - the exact key and value that will trigger this zone actions. 
- **onEnterAction** - the action that will be triggered when the user enters the zone defined by given key. 
- **onExitAction** - the action that will be triggered when the user exits the zone defined by given key. 
- **onChangeAction** - triggers when there is a change in proximity attachments of a given key. If the zone consists of more than one beacon, this will help tracking the ones that are nearby, while still remaining one `onEnter` and `onExit` event. 
- **inFarRange** - the far distance at which actions will be invoked. Notice that due to the nature of Bluetooth Low Energy, it is "desired" and not "exact." We are constantly improving the precision. 
- **inNearRange** - the near distance at which actions will be invoked.
- **inCustomRange** - custom desired trigger distance in meters. 

## 3. Start proximity observation
When you are done defining your rules, you will need to start the observation process:

```Kotlin
// Kotlin
val observationHandler = proximityObserver
               .addProximityZones(zone1, zone2, zone3)
               .withBalancedPowerMode()
               .withOnErrorAction{/* Do something here */}
               .startWithScannerInForegroundService(notification)
```

```Java
// Java
ProximityObserver.Handler observationHandler =
       proximityObserver.addProximityZones(zone1, zone2, zone3)
           .withBalancedPowerMode()
           .withOnErrorAction(new Function1<Throwable, Unit>() {
             @Override
             public Unit invoke(Throwable throwable) {
               /* Do something here */
               return null;
             }
           })
           .startWithScannerInForegroundService(notification);
```
- **addProximityZones** - adds your pre-defined zones to `ProximityObserver`.
- **lowLatencyPowerMode** - the most reliable mode, but may drain battery a lot. 
- **balancedPowerMode** - balance between scan reliability and battery drainage. 
- **lowPowerMode** - battery efficient mode, but not that reliable.
- **onErrorAction** - action triggered when any error occurs - such as cloud connection problems, scanning, etc.
- **startWithForegroundScanner** - starts the observation proces with scanner wrapped in Foreground Service. This will display notification in notifications bar, but will ensure that the scanning won't be killed by the system. It may even work after the user kills your app. 
- **startWithSimpleScanner** - starts the observation with scanner without any service. The scan will be destroyed when your app dies. Use this if you want to run a quick and simple scan, or you want to implement a service wrapper by yourself.

After start, the `ProximityObserver` will return `ProximityObserver.Handler` that you can use to stop scanning later. For example:
```Kotlin
// Kotlin
override fun onDestroy() {
    observationHandler.stop()
    super.onDestroy()
}
```

```Java
// Java
@Override
protected void onDestroy() {
    observationHandler.stop();
    super.onDestroy();
}
```

## Example app

To get a working prototype, check out the example app. It's a single screen app with three labels that change the background color when:

- you are in close proximity to the first desk,
- in close proximity to the second desk,
- when you are in the venue in general.

The demo requires at least two Proximity or Location beacons configured for Estimote Monitoring. It's enabled by default in dev kits shipped after mid-September 2017; to enable it on your own check out the [instructions](https://community.estimote.com/hc/en-us/articles/226144728-How-to-enable-Estimote-Monitoring-).

The demo expects beacons having specific tags assigned:

- `{"attachment":{"blueberry_desk":true,"venue":"office"}}` for the first one,
- `{"attachment":{"mint_desk":true,"venue":"office"}}` for the second one.

These attachments can be used to define the zones presented below:
